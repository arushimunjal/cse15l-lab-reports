**Step 3: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail.**

```
$ <ls>
$ <cd> <lab7> <enter>
$ bash t <tab> <enter>
```

> To run the tests, I used `ls` to find the files of the directory and `cd` to access and enter lab7. Then, I used <tab> to autocomplete `t` to become `test.sh`. `bash` ran the commands in the `test.sh` files.
  
**Step 4: Edit the code file to fix the failing test.**
  
**Step 5: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed.**
  
**Step 6: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account .**
